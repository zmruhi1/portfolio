## About me

I am Zurana Mehrin Ruhi from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BRAC University Bangladesh.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at University of Saarland while pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this website, I wish to document my experience during this program and overall, my tech life. 

Thanks for reading!
