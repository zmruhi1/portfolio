Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the University of Saarland while pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this website, I wish to document my experience during this program and overall, my tech life. To have an overview of my profile, please visit [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zmruhi/)
